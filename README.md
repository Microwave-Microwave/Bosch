# 2nd ELTE - Bosch Programming Contest

Welcome to my submission for the 2nd ELTE - Bosch Programming Contest! This repository showcases my journey and work on this exciting competition. Despite some unforeseen challenges, I am proud of the progress and results achieved. Here's a detailed overview of my project:

## Project Overview

### Data Analysis
I began the project by thoroughly analyzing the available data, which included both LiDAR sensor data and camera data. This step was crucial in understanding the input data and preparing it for subsequent processing and model training.

### Project Structure

#### 1. Image Generation from Point Cloud
Initially, I developed a method to generate images from the point cloud data. This was first implemented in C#, but I later transitioned to Python for better integration with machine learning frameworks.

#### 2. Model Training and Prediction
Using TensorFlow, I trained various models to make predictions based on the generated images. This involved experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Challenges and Reflections
Despite making significant progress, I had to withdraw from the competition at the last moment due to illness. This README is being created a year after the competition to document and reflect on my experience.

## Conclusion
Participating in the 2nd ELTE - Bosch Programming Contest was an invaluable experience. It provided me with the opportunity to work with advanced data types and improve my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development. Although I couldn't complete the competition, the knowledge and experience gained were immensely beneficial. :))

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project!
